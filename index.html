let text=`When I first saw you at our relative’s wedding on November 10, 2022, time literally stopped for me. Not in the dramatic cinema way 🎬… but in that quiet, overwhelming way where everything around you keeps moving, yet inside you, something freezes completely. The music was playing 🎶, people were talking, kids were running around, relatives were laughing loudly… but the moment my eyes found you, all of it faded into the background like a muted scene. In that single second, it felt like Cupid didn’t just shoot an arrow — he aimed straight at my soul 🏹❤️
I still remember the lights shining above, the scent of flowers in the air 🌸, the decorations glowing softly ✨… but somehow, all of that became blur. You stood there, unaware that someone across the hall had just lost control of his heartbeat. My heart beat in a way it never had before 💓. It wasn’t calm. It wasn’t steady. It was confused, excited, nervous, and strangely certain at the same time.
I didn’t understand what was happening… but I knew one thing — you were not ordinary. You were different. You were special 🌷. There was something about the way you smiled, something about the way you carried yourself, something about the way your eyes sparkled when you laughed. It didn’t feel temporary. It didn’t feel like a crush. It felt important.
And the funny part? You had absolutely no idea 😅. There I was trying to act normal, pretending to talk casually, while inside my brain was shouting, “Bro, this is not normal!” 🤦‍♂️🔥 My heart had clearly made a decision without even consulting me.
From that day, without even realizing it, you slowly became part of my everyday thoughts. Not in an obsessive way… but in a peaceful way. You became my calm in chaos 🌊, my smile during random boring afternoons ☀️, my quiet comfort during stressful nights 🌙. Even when we didn’t talk much, even when things felt uncertain, your existence alone gave me reassurance. It was strange and beautiful at the same time 🌼.
I waited for you. Not for attention. Not for time pass. Not because I had nothing better to do. But because what I felt was real ❤️‍🔥. Four long years. Four years of silently choosing you. Four years of telling myself, “If it’s meant to be, it will be.” Four years of praying in small quiet moments 🙏 that maybe one day, you would look at me the way I looked at you.
There were nights I questioned myself. There were days I felt foolish. There were moments I almost gave up. But every time I remembered your smile, something inside me said, “Stay.” 🕊️ So I stayed. Not loudly. Not dramatically. Just patiently.
And when you finally accepted me… that moment healed every second of waiting 🥹💫 It felt like the universe gently whispered, “See? I told you.” All those doubts, all those fears, all those lonely nights suddenly made sense. It was worth it. Every single second.
Because now… it is not “you” or “me.” It is US 🤍 And this “US” means more to me than those four years ever could. It’s not just a word. It’s a promise. It’s a partnership. It’s two imperfect people choosing each other every single day.
Listen to me carefully, my girl — I will never leave you. Not when things are easy. Not when things are hard. Not when life tests us. If the world stands against you 🌍, I will stand in front of you. If problems come, we face them together. If pain comes, we heal together. If success comes, we celebrate louder than everyone else together 🥂✨
You are not just someone I love. You are my safe place 🏡. My rabbit 🐰. My soft corner. My chaos and my calm. You didn’t just enter my life — you slowly became my life. You became part of my habits, my plans, my dreams, my future thoughts 🌈.
And yes… sometimes you’re dramatic 😌. Sometimes you overthink. Sometimes you act like you don’t need reassurance — but I know you do. And I love that about you too. I love your strength 💪. I love your vulnerability 💕. I love your stubbornness. I love the way you pretend to be serious but end up laughing first 😂.
You are not perfect. And neither am I. But somehow, together, we feel right. And that feeling is rare ✨.
On your birthday, I don’t just wish you happiness 🎂. I promise to be part of it. I promise to support your dreams 🌟. I promise to clap the loudest when you win. I promise to hold you when you’re tired. I promise to protect your heart the way I protect my own 💞.
This is your 18th birthday — a new chapter 📖. A new phase. Life will change. Age will change. Months will pass. People will come and go. But one thing will stay constant — me choosing you.
Maybe today I’m giving you a digital surprise 💻🎁. Maybe I’m writing words on a screen. But one day, I won’t need a website. I’ll be there beside you. I’ll hold your hand. I’ll stand next to you while you cut the cake 🎂. I’ll wipe the cream off your cheek. I’ll take pictures with you 📸. I’ll make sure your birthday feels warm, real, unforgettable.
Because you are not just my present. You are my future 🛤️.
Thank you for loving me. Thank you for choosing me. Thank you for believing in us. Thank you for becoming my “US.”
I love you in a way that words will never be enough to explain 💖✨ And no matter how many birthdays pass, no matter how old we grow, I will always look at you the same way I did on November 10, 2022 — like time just stopped… and my heart just found home 🏠💘`;
